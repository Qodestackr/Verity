BUSINESS TRACKS DRIVER ACTIVITIES IN /shipments.

<!--
✅ /shipments is the Right Home For:
Driver assignments: Who is delivering what and when
Delivery progress: Real-time status (e.g. en route, delivered, failed, returned)
Proof of delivery (POD): Signatures, photos, or notes attached to a shipment
Exception handling: Missed deliveries, issues, reroutes, etc.
Route performance analytics: Completion time, delays, efficiency
Driver logs: Activity per route/stop, rest periods, check-ins

"Your data is encrypted in motion and at rest."
"Access is scoped by role, channel, and warehouse."
"Only your business units see what they’re allowed to see."

# B2B Liquor Distribution Platform: Implementation Strategy

## Driver Experience: Focused Simplicity

Drivers need a distraction-free interface showing only what matters:

- **Customer/business name**
- **Drop location** with familiar landmarks
- **Product summary** (concise order details)
- **Status buttons** (Picked → En Route → Delivered)

_Future enhancements: mini-map, ETA calculator, "Call customer" button_

## Distributor Coordination Hub

Your backend already manages products, channels, stock, and location. Now it needs to function as a dispatch office.

## Implementation Status

### Successfully Implemented ✅

1. **Driver-Focused UI**

   - Clean, distraction-free interface
   - Essential delivery details (customer, address, items)
   - Quick action buttons (call, navigation)
   - Simple status updates workflow

2. **Fleet Management Dashboard**

   - Delivery assignment capabilities
   - Driver status tracking
   - Filterable delivery views
   - Detailed delivery information

3. **Core Workflows**
   - Order assignment process
   - Delivery status updates
   - Basic communication tools
   - Proof of delivery functionality

### Future Enhancements (When Ready) ⏱️

1. **Geofencing & Zones**

   - Draw delivery zones (Ruiru, Juja, Thika, CBD)
   - Auto-assignment based on location

2. **Advanced Routing**

   - Optimized multi-stop routes
   - ETA calculations

3. **Performance Analytics**
   - Driver efficiency metrics
   - Delivery time analysis

## Next Backend Steps

When ready to enhance the backend:

1. Create API endpoints for delivery management
2. Implement authentication for drivers and admins
3. Build assignment logic
4. Set up real-time status updates
5. Develop notification system

## Fleet Management System Vision

### 1. Driver Management

- Add/remove/edit drivers
- Assign drivers to zones or delivery networks
- Track availability status

### 2. Zone Management

- Define geographic service areas
- Assign zones to depots or fleets
- Auto-assign orders based on delivery address

### 3. Delivery Assignment

- Visual board of unassigned orders
- Manual or automated assignment based on:
  - Location
  - Time window
  - Load capacity

### 4. Order Tracking

- Real-time driver location (optional)
- Order status monitoring
- Customer notifications

### 5. Performance Analytics

- Deliveries per driver per day
- Failed delivery analysis
- Actual vs. planned delivery times

## Scaling Considerations

When you reach:

- 20+ orders per day
- 5+ delivery vehicles
- 3+ zones/regions

Manual assignment becomes inefficient. Your platform's value increases with:

- Route optimization
- Fleet load balancing
- Driver performance tracking

## Supply Chain Integration

- **Brand Owners (KWAL, EABL)**: Inventory visibility, distribution metrics
- **Distributors**: Fleet management, order fulfillment
- **Wholesalers**: Order placement, delivery tracking

The current UI foundation is solid. Focus on connecting these interfaces to your backend APIs and implementing the business logic that will power the entire system.
