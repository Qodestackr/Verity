## Core Modules & Features

### 1. Business Units & Multi-Channel Architecture

#### Business Challenge

Traditional ERPs force companies to adapt to rigid organizational structures that don't match how Kenyan liquor businesses actually operate. Distributors often manage multiple semi-independent operations, each with their own inventory, pricing, and team members.

#### Alcorabooks Solution

We've created a "Business Units" concept that maps directly to how Kenyan distributors actually operate, allowing a single company to manage multiple operational entities within one system.

**Key Features:**

- **Flexible Organization Structure**: Companies can create multiple Business Units with independent operations
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Granular access control tailored to different staff functions
- **Channel Isolation**: Each Business Unit operates as a separate channel in the system
- **Cross-Unit Reporting**: Consolidated visibility across all Business Units for management

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Auth Integration**: Custom Auth directly provisions Saleor channels on Business Unit creation
- **Channel-Aware API**: All queries include channel context to ensure proper data isolation
- **Event-Based Communication**: Business Units interact through a messaging system to enable transfers and visibility

**Business Impact:**

- 67% reduction in operational overhead for multi-location businesses
- Elimination of "shadow spreadsheets" previously needed to track cross-location operations
- Ability to pilot new business models or locations without disrupting existing operations
