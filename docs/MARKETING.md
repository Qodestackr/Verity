The challenge is making a dynamic marketing tool that is Retailer-first. Then fight to adapt it up the chain.

TODO:

- remove /marketing/links so that the system internally generates them, reducing complexity

### Template Creator Enhancements:

**Canvas Rendering Implementation**

- Have basic canvas rendering logic that actually draws on the canvas working
- Include placeholder implementation for background, product image, text, and CTA button
- Added comments for future comprehensive rendering engine development

**Image Export Functionality**

- Implemented basic canvas-to-PNG export functionality
- Added comments for future enhancements (multiple formats, resolution options)

**Link Management System**

- Enhanced the template-link integration with better structure
- Added comments for developing a proper link shortening service

### Major TODOs with Time Estimates:

**Canvas Rendering Engine (3-4 days)**

- Proper background rendering (gradients, patterns)
- Image loading and positioning
- Text rendering with proper fonts and styles

**Template Management System (1-2 weeks)**

- Template categories and collections
- Versioning and history
- Sharing and permissions

**Link Shortening Service (1-2 weeks)**

- Dedicated link shortening backend
- Analytics and tracking
- A/B testing functionality

**QR Code Generation (2-3 days)**

- Actual QR code generation instead of placeholders
- Customization options (colors, logo)
- Analytics for QR code scans

**Analytics Dashboard (1-2 weeks)**

- Real-time analytics charts
- Detailed metrics (clicks, unique visitors, devices, locations)
- Conversion tracking and visualization
