Use a Hybrid Model: Store core data in Saleor but enhance it with your own tables in your Postgres instance
Synchronization Layer: Create a service that keeps your local database in sync with Saleor for the overlapping data
ETL Processes: Extract data from Saleor, transform it for analytics purposes, and load it into analytics-optimized tables
Real-time Data: For POS operations, consider using your local database as the primary source with eventual consistency back to Saleor
This approach gives you the best of both worlds - Saleor's robust e-commerce capabilities combined with custom retail-specific functionality in your own database.
