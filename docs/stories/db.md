## Analytics in Drizzle vs. Prisma

### Clear Answer: Drizzle IS genuinely better for analytics

Drizzle is legitimately superior for analytics workloads because:

1. **Complex Aggregations**: Drizzle lets you write SQL-like aggregations directly, while Prisma has limitations with complex grouping and window functions
2. **Raw Performance**: Analytics queries that process large datasets run faster in Drizzle due to less overhead
3. **Query Flexibility**: Drizzle allows you to express virtually any SQL query your database supports, while Prisma restricts you to what its API exposes

### Real Example: Analytics Query Comparison

**Complex analytics query in Drizzle:**

```ts
// Sales by product category by month with growth calculation
const salesAnalytics = await db
  .select({
    month: sql`DATE_TRUNC('month', ${orders.createdAt})`,
    category: products.category,
    totalSales: sql`SUM(${orderItems.quantity} * ${orderItems.price})`,
    orderCount: sql`COUNT(DISTINCT ${orders.id})`,
    growthRate: sql`(SUM(${orderItems.quantity} * ${orderItems.price}) - 
                    LAG(SUM(${orderItems.quantity} * ${orderItems.price})) OVER (
                      PARTITION BY ${products.category} 
                      ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', ${orders.createdAt})
                    )) / 
                    NULLIF(LAG(SUM(${orderItems.quantity} * ${orderItems.price})) OVER (
                      PARTITION BY ${products.category} 
                      ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', ${orders.createdAt})
                    ), 0) * 100`,
  })
  .from(orderItems)
  .innerJoin(orders, eq(orderItems.orderId, orders.id))
  .innerJoin(products, eq(orderItems.productId, products.id))
  .where(gte(orders.createdAt, new Date("2023-01-01")))
  .groupBy(sql`DATE_TRUNC('month', ${orders.createdAt})`, products.category)
  .orderBy(sql`DATE_TRUNC('month', ${orders.createdAt})`, products.category);
```

**Same query in Prisma:**

```ts
// You can't do this directly in Prisma!
// You'd need to use Prisma.$queryRaw or break it into multiple queries
const monthlyData = await prisma.$queryRaw`
  SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', "Order"."createdAt") as month,
    "Product"."category",
    SUM("OrderItem"."quantity" * "OrderItem"."price") as "totalSales",
    COUNT(DISTINCT "Order"."id") as "orderCount",
    (SUM("OrderItem"."quantity" * "OrderItem"."price") - 
      LAG(SUM("OrderItem"."quantity" * "OrderItem"."price")) OVER (
        PARTITION BY "Product"."category" 
        ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', "Order"."createdAt")
      )) / 
      NULLIF(LAG(SUM("OrderItem"."quantity" * "OrderItem"."price")) OVER (
        PARTITION BY "Product"."category" 
        ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', "Order"."createdAt")
      ), 0) * 100 as "growthRate"
  FROM "OrderItem"
  INNER JOIN "Order" ON "OrderItem"."orderId" = "Order"."id"
  INNER JOIN "Product" ON "OrderItem"."productId" = "Product"."id"
  WHERE "Order"."createdAt" >= '2023-01-01'
  GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', "Order"."createdAt"), "Product"."category"
  ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', "Order"."createdAt"), "Product"."category"
`;
```

### Why This Matters for Our Platform

For our SaaS platform with accounting features, we'll need analytics for:

_A Python module in FastAPI does not come to save us if all we end up doing is using alchemy. Our data lives in TS codebase with TS ORMs and Drizzle is the real deal._

1. **Financial reporting**: Complex aggregations across time periods
2. **Customer insights**: Segmentation and cohort analysis
3. **Inventory analytics**: Turnover rates and valuation methods
4. **Sales performance**: Multi-dimensional analysis by product, customer type, region

Drizzle gives you direct access to the full power of SQL for these use cases, while Prisma forces you to either:

- Use `prisma.$queryRaw` (which defeats the purpose of using Prisma)
- Break complex analytics into multiple simpler queries (hurting performance)
- Build workarounds for missing features

### The Bottom Line

For a platform where analytics will be a core feature (like our accounting module), Drizzle's approach is genuinely superior - not marketing BS. The SQL-like syntax directly translates to more powerful analytics capabilities with better performance.

Since analytics is central to our platform's value proposition, Drizzle is the clear winner.

MORE POINTS:

- Performance at Scale especially as database grows.

- TS-first approach + excellent type safety without the overhead of Prisma's schema generation process.

- Flexibility with Saleor: Since we're integrating with Saleor (which handles 60% of our needs), we deserve an ORM that's more flexible for the custom parts. Drizzle gives us more direct control over SQL queries when needed.

- Lighter Weight: Drizzle has a smaller footprint and faster startup times, which is beneficial for serverless environments.

- Simpler Migration Path: For the "messy needs" that keep popping up in the Kenyan market, Drizzle's more straightforward migration system will be easier to adapt quickly.

**When Prisma Would Be Better**:

Prisma would be the better choice if:

- Needed its more comprehensive auto-generated CRUD operations
- Team was less experienced with SQL fundamentals [NO]
- value the Prisma Studio for database management
- Needed the more mature relations handling for extremely complex data models [YES]

OUR PLATFORM NEEDS TO WRAP SALEOR AND O THE DB IS FOR:

- User management & authentication (beyond what Saleor provides)
- Subscription billing & plan management
- Feature access control (free vs. paid features)
- The accounting module we've been building
- Custom B2B/B2C extensions to Saleor

Drizzle will handle these needs efficiently while bringing the flexibility to adapt to the unique requirements of the Kenyan market without the overhead of Prisma's abstraction layer.

<!-- Kysley is another massive contender. -->

<!--
Here's a simple Drizzle example to show how straightforward it is:
```ts
// Define your schema
import { pgTable, serial, text, integer } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

export const customers = pgTable('customers', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  name: text('name').notNull(),
  email: text('email').notNull().unique(),
  creditLimit: integer('credit_limit').default(0)
});

// Use it in your application
import { db } from '@/lib/db';
import { customers } from '@/schema';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';

// Query
const getCustomer = async (id: number) => {
  return await db.select().from(customers).where(eq(customers.id, id));
}

// Insert
const createCustomer = async (data: { name: string, email: string }) => {
  return await db.insert(customers).values(data).returning();
}
```
