Brew Edge SaaS: The Ruthless Focus Plan

🔥 No timelines. No vague promises. Just shipped features.

1️⃣ AUTHENTICATION (BetterAuth) ✅

    Multi-tenant setup → Users onboard as Retailer or Distributor
    Org-based roles → Features adapt to user type
    Login, sign-up, invites, JWT handling (Done right or not at all)

2️⃣ SUBSCRIPTIONS + PAYMENTS (Mpesa & Paystack) ⏳

    No Stripe. Africa-first payment logic (Mpesa first, Paystack optional)
    Custom billing logic (recurring payments, usage-based if needed)
    Subscription status sync → Feature access control

3️⃣ POSTGRES (Neon) + API-First Data Layer

    Nuqs (event-driven sync) + Custom TanStack tables
    Multi-tenancy baked into DB (schema or row-level auth?)
    Performance scaling & locking down security early

4️⃣ PRODUCT ORDERING + STOCK TRACKING

    Retailers can order from distributors
    Stock updates in real-time
    Sales flow MVP-level polished before expanding

No scope creep. No "let’s add this too." Each step unlocks the next.

    🚀 If it’s not on today’s todo list, it doesn’t exist.
    Each flow should be so clear it forces progress without distraction.

🔗 Next Action? Ship Auth First. Then payments. Then sales flow.
That’s it.
