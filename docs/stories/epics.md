## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

1. **Authentication First**: Complete the entire authentication epic before moving to subscriptions. Make it bulletproof.
2. **One Flow at a Time**: Perfect each user story before moving to the next. No half-finished features.
3. **Daily Deep Work**: Schedule 2-hour blocks of uninterrupted focus time for the most complex parts.
4. **Test Obsessively**: Create comprehensive tests for each component, especially authentication and payment flows.
5. **Document as You Build**: Write clear documentation for each completed feature, explaining not just how it works but why it was built that way.

Remember your productivity philosophy: "If it's not on today's to-do list, it doesn't exist." Focus on one story at a time, make it exceptional, then move forward.

The foundation you build now will determine how solid the entire Alcorabooks platform becomes. Make every component worthy of being showcased.
