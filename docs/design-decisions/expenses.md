## Expense Entry at POS

Expenses can be entered directly during the **point of sale (POS)** or manually by the retailer. Here's how the system captures these transactions:

### **How It Works**

1. **Quick Expense Entry**:  
   Retailers can select an expense category, input the amount, and optionally attach a receipt photo. This is done directly during checkout or in a dedicated expense form.

2. **Categories**:  
   Expenses must be categorized under predefined types such as **Transport**, **Inventory Purchases**, **Utilities**, etc.

3. **Amount Tracking**:  
   The system logs the amount spent for each entry and updates the retailer's balance.

4. **Snapshot of Expenses**:  
   Retailers can see a quick summary of their recorded expenses, showing the date, amount, and category of each entry.

## Recurring Expenses

Some expenses, like **transportation costs** or **rent**, are recurring. Retailers can automate the tracking of these regular expenses.

### **How Recurring Expenses Work**

1. **Set Recurrence**:  
   Retailers can select whether an expense repeats daily, weekly, monthly, or at another interval. For example, rent might recur every 30 days, and transport costs could recur every week.
2. **Automatic Reminders**:  
   The system sends automatic reminders when it's time to log a recurring expense. This ensures that retailers donâ€™t forget about key costs.

## Expense Reporting

### **Daily/Weekly/Monthly Summary**

Retailers can generate **expense reports** to see their total costs over a selected period.

1. **Expense-to-Revenue Ratio**:  
   Retailers can compare their total expenses to their **sales revenue** to understand profitability. This report can help identify areas where costs are disproportionately high.

2. **Detailed Expense Breakdown**:  
   A breakdown of expenses by category shows where money is being spent most. For example, you can see how much the business spends on **transportation** versus **inventory purchases**.

3. **Low Stock and Aging Reports**:  
   Automated reports that flag low-stock situations and highlight slow-moving inventory. This will help retailers understand whether spending on stock is effective.

## Mobile Expense Management

Expenses are designed to be managed on the go with a **mobile-friendly interface**. Retailers can log expenses directly from their mobile device, providing flexibility and convenience.

### **Mobile Features**

1. **Quick Expense Entry**:  
   A simple form allows the retailer to log expenses quickly from their phone.
2. **Photo Upload**:  
   Retailers can snap photos of receipts and attach them to their expense entries for verification.
3. **Expense Notifications**:  
   Push notifications remind the retailer of upcoming recurring expenses, ensuring timely payments.

## Future Features (Optional)

As the platform grows, we can integrate more advanced features based on feedback and business needs:

1. **Vendor Management**:  
   Track which vendors provide which products and their associated costs. This will allow for better expense analysis based on supplier relationships.

2. **Invoice Integration**:  
   Retailers can attach or match **invoices** to expense records, ensuring proper documentation.
