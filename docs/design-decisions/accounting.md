# Accounting System for SMEs

This document outlines a simplified accounting system for small to SMEs in the liquor distribution space. Our goal is to offer essential accounting features that streamline financial tracking, without overcomplicating the process for smaller businesses who cannot afford complex ERP systems.

## Key Features

1. **Expense Tracking**

   - **Simple Expense Categorization:** SMEs can track day-to-day expenses such as lunch, transport, new equipment, etc., and categorize them easily (e.g., "Transport", "Supplies", "Advertising").
   - **Basic Reporting:** Generate basic reports to view total expenses within a selected period.

2. **Invoicing & Quotes**

   - **Create Invoices:** SMEs can easily generate invoices for their customers, with the ability to include taxes, payment methods, and due dates.
   - **Quote Generation:** Provide preliminary pricing (quotes) to customers before they commit to full orders. These quotes can later be converted into invoices.
   - **Invoice Management:** Track unpaid, partially paid, and paid invoices.

3. **Revenue Tracking**

   - **Sales Overview:** Get an overview of sales with details like product sold, price, tax, and payment status.
   - **Payment Reconciliation:** Track payments received (via MPESA, cash, or card), ensuring they match against issued invoices.

4. **Customer Management**

   - **Customer Profiles:** Manage customer information, such as contact details and order history.
   - **Payment History:** Keep track of individual customer payments, pending balances, and due invoices.

5. **Basic Financial Reporting**

   - **Revenue Reports:** Track overall revenue over time, with the ability to filter by date range, product, or customer.
   - **Profitability Insights:** Basic calculations of profits after expenses, helping SMEs understand their financial health.

6. **Banking Integration (Optional for Larger SMEs)**

   - **Sync Payments & Expenses:** Integrate with banking APIs to auto-sync payments and expenses directly from the bank account.
   - **Bank Reconciliation:** Automatically match transactions from the bank to recorded payments and expenses.

7. **Tax Compliance**
   - **VAT Calculation:** Automatically calculate VAT for each sale, track tax collected, and issue VAT receipts.
   - **E-TIMS Integration (Future Feature):** Seamless integration with Kenya's tax system for easy VAT reporting.

## Vision for Growth: Scalability for Larger Distributors

While the core system focuses on SMEs, we recognize the needs of larger distributors. For these users, the solution can scale with features like:

- **Integration with ERP Systems:** Syncing financial data with ERPNext, QuickBooks, Xero, or other systems for larger businesses. This includes syncing orders, payments, and taxes to manage accounting at a higher level.
- **Advanced Financial Reporting:** P&L statements, balance sheets, and cash flow reports for more complex needs.
- **Full General Ledger Support:** For businesses that need detailed transaction tracking and double-entry bookkeeping.

## Architecture Considerations

- **Cloud-Based:** The system will be hosted on a scalable platform, ensuring ease of access and data safety.
- **Real-Time Syncing:** Sync sales, payments, and expenses in real-time with the bank and ERP systems, ensuring up-to-date financial data.
- **Simplicity First:** Focus on easy-to-use features without overwhelming users with unnecessary complexities. The goal is to ensure that users can keep track of their finances efficiently.

## Conclusion

The SME accounting system should offer a no-fuss approach to managing the most essential aspects of business finances. By focusing on small but impactful features, we empower businesses to gain better control over their finances without the overhead of enterprise-level software. As they grow, the system will scale with them, allowing for integrations and more advanced features.
