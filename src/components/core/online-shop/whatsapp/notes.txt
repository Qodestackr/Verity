We have a long way to go with WhatsApp API. From deciding the cheapest route and it definitely aint an MVP feature.
With large customer base, its easy to become a Meta business partner and use cheaper Meta Cloud APIs instead of wrappers
like Gushup, Dialog360, Wati or Others (Sukhiba). They rarely update pricing terms
business should be able to configure and get started with "MANAGE WhatsApp ORDERS" via dash (We dont have this and we wont have anytime soon)
For now, this guides the direction we wish to take..
